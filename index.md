## Welcome to 张 Pages


什么语法也不会啊

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/F-cook/frank.github.io/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

好像写中文也可以吧

### Markdown 额

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### 标题 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [Basic writing and formatting syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax).

### Jekyll Themes

Jekyll 大概就是用来做这个的

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/F-cook/frank.github.io/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
